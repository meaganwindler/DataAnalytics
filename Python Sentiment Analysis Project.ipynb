      "I wanted to love this shirt. It's hard to find a unique top in black and white that has vertical rather than horizontal striping. This one is almost perfect -- but for the way it is pleated right at the v-neck, which makes this strange little pull-apart at the front bust area. I got my usual shirt size (medium), but perhaps large would have been better. Other reviewers have noted this, but I didn't think it would be as noticeable with the vertical pattern. Unfortunately, it's MORE so, in my opinion, especially when looking down -- which is so distracting and disconcerting. SO...if you're getting this pattern, perhaps size up unless you are very small/flat chested. The materials is matte look and light and breezy. Love the feel.\n",

I will say about this is that it is pretty absorbent so if you happen to get it wet it stick to the skin. It is pretty comfortable to wear and fits pretty well. It feels pretty good on the skin so you do not have to worry about it chafing and such. It looks great and works for again casual wear. It is machine washable and dryer friendly which is nice. It does collect sweat so it may stick to your skin. It is also not something I would run through the dryer. I would definitely air dry this if possible. The stitching is pretty strong so you do not have to worry about rips and tears which is nice.

Then that afternoon I felt a draft on the back of my leg. I reached down only to find a tear in them. When I got home and put on an older pair. When I examined them, there was about a 1 inch by 1 inch right angle tear in them. After further tear examining them, there was another small tear next to the top of the rear pocket. I contacted Amazon and they replaced them right away.I started wearing the replacement pair. This was around mid February. Around 6 weeks ago, one of the bottom part of a belt loops tore off. Yesterday when I put these newest pair on I noticed the bottom part of another loops tore off. Examining them further, there are small tears next to the top of both rear pockets.Back in the day when I was working I used to buy anywhere from 4 and up to 12 pair of Lee jeans a year according to what kind of work I was doing. Now that I’m retired, I buy a new pair of jeans around once a year. I usually I have 1 new pair and around 4 to 5 old pairs to rotate. I’ve always mark the date that I bought them on the inside tags. So I know the older ones from the newer ones.  In the past 5 months, I only wore these jeans, maybe 25 to 30 days.Maybe I happened to get 2 defected pairs.

      "Not the same as the Lee jeans that I've been buying for many, many years. I order a pair in January and the first time I wore them they fit great. Very relaxed as they should be. Then that afternoon I felt a draft on the back of my leg. I reached down only to find a tear in them. When I got home and put on an older pair. When I examined them, there was about a 1 inch by 1 inch right angle tear in them. After further tear examining them, there was another small tear next to the top of the rear pocket. I contacted Amazon and they replaced them right away.I started wearing the replacement pair. This was around mid February. Around 6 weeks ago, one of the bottom part of a belt loops tore off. Yesterday when I put these newest pair on I noticed the bottom part of another loops tore off. Examining them further, there are small tears next to the top of both rear pockets.Back in the day when I was working I used to buy anywhere from 4 and up to 12 pair of Lee jeans a year according to what kind of work I was doing. Now that I’m retired, I buy a new pair of jeans around once a year. I usually I have 1 new pair and around 4 to 5 old pairs to rotate. I’ve always mark the date that I bought them on the inside tags. So I know the older ones from the newer ones.  In the past 5 months, I only wore these jeans, maybe 25 to 30 days.Maybe I happened to get 2 defected pairs. I will buy one more pair and put them into rotation. If I have a problem again, I will have to try another brand.\n",

The tags were loose in the bag(one bag, not in two like the 2nd pair), a belt loop was broke, there was white paint on the front thigh, a thread bare spot at the fastener, a bleach spot on the back of one leg, and overall they were much faded compared to the 2nd pair.  Lastly, this one pair did not that new feel to it, and very wrinkled in the bag!! OMG!  What gives here!  Definitely returning and want buyers to watch carefully what they receive. Note, the second pair seemed fine with tags in tact and none of the above deformities that the other had,  and it was double bagged, but it makes me think twice about who may have worn them anyhow!\n",

The top unbuttons fully and has a lot of stretch so you do not need to unbutton it to put it on.

      "As pajamas go, these are quite comfortable. I ordered for my sister who came to visit for a few weeks over the holidays, and she was pleased with them. It's hard to find soft pajamas in larger sizes as they are often made with viscose fiber or are the really fuzzy flannel kind that hold in so much body heat you can't wear them even in the dead of winter without having heatstroke. It's also hard to find larger sized pajamas that aren't poorly and cheaply made. So far these pajamas have held up well - none of the stitching has come loose, especially that around the waistband. There is some very minor pilling on the front of the top, but it's quickly taken care of with a fabric shaver. The lilac color is pretty, though a bit see-through. A plain, thin white t-shirt solved that problem. My sister likes these enough that she wants another pair, but there seems to be a stocking issue with her size in most of the colors.\n",

      "First of all, I purchased these at Target.  But they are the same as what is on this page and I want to get another pair because they are good for work.  The biggest issues are the following:The first and weirdest is that if you look at the photo (and it's hard to see), there are tiny yellowish strands that appear on the surface as the pants wear.  At first I thought I had brushed up against some pollen, but after washing and wearing they are becoming more numerous on high traffic spots.  I haven't figured out how to get rid of them.  I feel like if they weren't there, the pants wouldn't look faded.Second, the back pockets ARE too small (see the one start reviews).  My wallet has dropped out twice, luckily in the car as I was getting out.  The left rear stitching also came apart causing me to not be able to use it until a repair was done.Why three stars?  Because they fit me correctly, and the zip pocket on the side is useful.  The durability is the question, I've had these for daily wear for around 5 months. They are perfect for my job because it's more about function than appearance...  So I will buy them again.

      "As long as you’re not a delicate little flower.  Then these are fine shirts. Good thick fabric, 100% cotton (but low thread count feel), will shrink, NOT tagless but tag rips off easily.For this price point, there is no point in complaining as if you paid more so here are some things to expect:It’s 100% cotton so it’s going to shrink since it’s not “pre-shrunk”It’s possible these are “fake” as many claim, or it may be Hanes cutting back on quality control. There is no way to knowing one way or another but here are some observations.Got 3 packs and 1 shirt had a hole in the back already.Shirts will NOT arrive in Factory branded bags, they’ll be in generic sealed plastic bags (my guess is because its easier for “try before you buy returns” to be folded/packaged/resealed for the next buyer) so wash before wearing.This is NOT tagless, but the tag does tear off easily. This doesn’t PROVE these are fake of knock offs (Maybe Hanes has a large stockpile of tags they can sew on for the cost of nothing instead of spending on the special ink, running the machinery and employees trained to operate said machinery to get that tagless. Idk.These are most likely 100% cotton as claimed so they WILL shrink! I find the larger the shirt size the more they will shrink relative to their size. So plan accordingly.A common complaint is that they’re itchy. All I can say is WASH BEFORE WEARING as you should be anyways. Ever heard of demodex mites? Now you have.Another complaint is that they feel rough. this isn’t 3000 thread count Egyptian cotton feeling more like 300 thread count. With that said these are FAR thicker than the genuine Hanes shirts I’ve bought in store in the last few years. Personally, I’ve never noticed.Bottom line: If you are the type of guy who may not even own a pair of cargo pants (anymore) but loved them because of its functionality. Who knows what SAE/metric is, and doesn’t wear tight jeans (by choice).Chances are very high you’ll be happy with these.$2.50/shirt + tax\n",

      "TL;DR: inspect the item before deciding to keep it. Pay special attention to the stitching on the shoulders and how well the buttons are attached to the shirt.I bought the shirt as part of an effort to expand my work wardrobe. I was looking for a linen shirt and this shirt kept showing up over and over. It had good reviews and came in most of the colors I was looking for. However, there were some things that worried me. 1) the buttons. They were barely holding on. And by that I mean they were holding on by 2 threads and the rest already looked like they were fraying. 2) the feel. Despite the tag stating that it was 30% linen, it didn't feel like linen at all. It felt like 100% polyester. 3) not a lot of stretch especially around the mid section and the back so careful how you move your arms. Overall I recommend the shirt and its a decent shirt but I'd prefer something similar even from an Amazon brand.\n",

      "I've never done a review on a sweater because most people already know what a sweater is but this is without a doubt my new favorite sweater in my entire wardrobe, seriously.I'll probably order 2 more to store away for the future.  From my shopping experiences, I don't touch any Amazon Brands/Goodthreads/etc because it's mostly low-quality crap (sorry but that's the truth).This sweater, however, breaks that mold completely.I never expected something of this quality for under $30 shipped to my door. Every bit of the stiching, from the arms to collar to waist are impeccable and double/triple sewn for durability not just a once over like an old navy or gap piece.  Secondly, the material is high-quality and thick in a good way (not heavy enough to bake you, but it stops that cold winter wind solidly it doesn't cut through).Back to the stiching: The bear design? It's not some cheap iron-on, it's sewn through the entire sweater so I can already tell I'm never going to see any pilling/peeling/fraying but let's say 3 years down the line it does fray a little, it's the perfect style for that anyway for me because the sweater reminds of an irish cabeknit with the warm ring-collar and all.I couldn't be more pleased really, and I think I'm going to start giving Goodthreads another chance because they are definitely stepping their game up.\n",

I did not notice them against my skin as much as I do poly blends, and I found them to breathe well and to not make me uncomfortably sweaty the way poly blends do.)The one shortcoming they may have is that they do not do all that well in the dryer.  To get around this, I let them lie flat until they are nearly dry and then just run them in the dryer for 15-20 minutes at low heat to get the last of the moisture out of them.

      "Loved it ! I wanted to buy an attractive and comfortable sweater that was ideal for me to wear outside on really chilly Florida winter days without a wearing another layer , as  I had already bought from other companies several attractive but thinner and lighter knit cotton sweaters ( which I could use indoors comfortably when it was a bit too cool , but that required more layering on really cold days if I wanted to go outside.  This thicker sweater washed and dried really well in my washer drier , as did my  light and thin sweaters. It washed well with clothes of similar colors .Useful hint: I did not have to dry it separately, I find that drying my thick cotton sweater in larger similar color towel loads on high heat kept it in perfect shape and prevented any wrinkling.\n",

Super warm, which I love. There are snaps that hold the sweater together where the toggles are. Not necessary as the toggles are functional.The medium fits comfortably, not terribly over sized, definitely not skin tight. The Large definitely gives the over sized vibe, however the large one puckers funny at the hem, definitely seems like an issue with shoddy stitching. Washed and line dried, it still puckers. Also, when the sweaters are snapped the space between pulls open when you sit down, which looks weird.I plan on keeping both, I may be able to fix the stitching issues on the large one.\n",

Got tired of wearing hoodies so this is a wonderful change and gives me a nice happy boost wearing them.  I wash them in my front load with all my other clothes and into the dryer full cycle.  If they shrink slightly so easy to just stretch to your liking and they will stay that way.  These sweaters do pill but i love them much no stars taken off.  They are flattering and not too tight or too loose, I like my sweaters on the bigger side so I can wear a long sleeve tee underneath.  I don’t think you would want to wear the material without a tee underneath although they are nice and soft.  I had bought the lavender as a gift and the color is gorgeous.

I am wearing a well-fitting bra in these shots, but the way the lacy material is attached (loosely and sloppily) makes me look like my girls have seen a lot more decades than they actually have. If you don't believe me, I took a photo right after the others, same perspective and wearing the exact same bra. Do you see the boobies of an old lady in the last shot like you do in the dress shots? I sincerely hope not. I'm not THAT old yet. I can tell that nothing would improve by changing the size of the dress; rather, something is very inherently wrong in how this was stitched together. The boobs are too close together, there's this weird droop happening, huge gaps between the liner and the lace, etc. Unfortunately, I had a million things happening in my life at the time this arrived, and I didn't try it on until 2 months after receiving it, so I can't return it. I guess the one positive thing is that the color is truly lovely. I wish I could wear it without feeling like I lost the battle with gravity decades ago, though!\n",

      "For starters, there is no tag. Amazon mercifully has a stamped logo where a scratchy itchy tag would normally be. This is huge for me as I have sensitive skin. So thank you, Amazon, for thinking of the wearer. The dress is a stretchy jersey knit, like a soft t-shirt. I am 6' and 165 pounds. After one wash, the dress hits just above my ankle, which is perfect. I wouldn't have minded if it was a few inches shorter. The dress hangs really well. I am small busted and the top doesn't diminish my bust even further, even without a bra. The only downside is for folks that have a ventless condensation dryer, such as Bosch. The lint this generates on the first wash and dry will have you cleaning the entire condensation system through to the sump pump on the dryer for sure. It's a massive amount. Of course if you have a normal venting dryer, the huge amount of lint can get stuck in the vent pipe. Be sure to check / clean since lint build-up in a dryer vent pipe can lead to fire (hence my opting for the ventless).\n",

This causes the top to gap a lot more than it might for someone who was more.... proportional.The waist is high, which could be flattering but I always feel like high waisted dresses make me look pregnant. And while I can pull this one (as it's stretchy) more to a comfortable place, the elastic at the 'waist' and my figure will just... pull it back up.Also, considering the base is white to the pattern I got - I'm not surprised that it's slightly see through.

I fell in love with this dress, and would recommend it to anyone looking for something that's flattering without being over the top.\n",

Washing in cold water on gentle/handwash cycle and flat dry. No color change or change in size or qoulaty of fabric. Dark green had little bit color bleed during first washing but I had it in prewash bucket because I made stain, bleed was minimal especially for 1st washing. They become my favorite dresses this summer for hot Arizona days. I wear them at home as well to go out to not very fancy. Wear assist is as well with belts-looks wounderful and fabric feels very nice on the skin. I probably will order even more in other colors they have. I wish they had more colors without print like true Yellow and orange. I got all my dresses on lightning deals so I don't payed full price nd it gives me extra satisfaction as well.

I am 5'9\" and 160lbs with much of my weight in the hip area. I ordered both the black and mushroom, one in M and one in L based on many different reviews so I could evaluate the sizing and colors. Both were a nice weight material and no light shows thru when held up to the light. The black is a richer black than I was expecting based on the description of  \"off black\" and the mushroom is a great neutral. The straps are adjustable with buttons in the back. My bustline is about 36C and the large was a little loose around the torso. It wasn't a bad look but the medium fit better and I was able to adjust the straps so that I didn't get the cut across my bustline that some reviewers mentioned regarding the mushroom color. It was a great length for my height and I ended up returning the L and reordering in a M so that I now have one in each color. It is super cute on its own or with an open shirt over the top or tied at the waist.\n",

Then when I visited Amazon again saw it was $35.50, I grabbed it. The only down side is I need matching petite jacket to go with this sheath dress. Bare arms are not appropriate in certain settings. I would like the material to be the same. On the other sight I purchased a black sheath dress and purchase the jacket.  The reason I am purchasing a black sheath dress is to rebuild my wardrobe. I was 250 pounds and now I am 150 pounds. Every lady should have a black dress in her wardrobe. No special occasion I prefer to be prepared. This black dress in size 10 is perfect. May be a little long, that is fine. This way my thighs won't be showing. I am modest and conservative in my taste in my clothing.  I was very impressed by the zipper and lining. Exquisite placing of the zipper. Details are important. The material is comfortable to touch. And the size 10 hug my body perfectly. Great fit, great feel for this price of $35.50.

Since I buy sheath dresses with my hips in mind, I was concerned that this garment would not fit my bustline properly. It did!  This is probably due to the princess seams down the front. It fits well through the shoulders, and although the underarms are cut lower than expected, they did not gap or reveal my bra. The material is quality,  it is nicely lined, and has a stylish kick pleat in the back.  The back zipper is hidden discretely in the back seam. My only complaint is that the hem is below my knees; this will need to be altered by a seamstress. I paired the dress with a sparkly hip-length formal jacket, and also a more casual blouson top, and both combinations “worked”. I think I will wear this often!\n",

      "I’m 5’6” and 145 lbs (bottom heavy). I’m always between sizes. Sometimes between medium and small. Sometimes between medium and large. Since this is a tent dress, it was between medium and small. The dress on the left is the medium and the dress on the right is the small. The biggest differences are the length and the top. I hate my knees. I can’t explain it. I don’t pretend that that’s a normal feeling, but here we are. I have avoided shorts and dresses shorter than midi length for most of my life. BUT I live in south Louisiana and it’s just too hot for all that nonsense, and I’m older and wiser now. So you can see the difference in length. I think in real life it’s only an inch, but to me that’s the difference between being comfortable and not being comfortable. The second thing that you probably can’t see is the top part is a little tighter. Although I probably would have liked how the top fit better, the length won the toss up. If you actually have anything bigger than an A cup keep the top in mind. I am a 34A (so is my 11 year old), so I don’t usually have to worry about tops being “too tight”. The mid section doesn’t touch me at all so I like that part because I don’t have to hold anything in or wear a torture device. This color is nice and the material is so soft. I’ll probably wear a slip because it’s a little sheer and being an educator I cannot take that chance because too many teenagers have phones. I wouldn’t give it a 5 because unless you are a toothpick I wouldn’t use “flattering” to describe it, but it’s a keeper because it’s easy and comfortable and the price is nice.\n",

The fabric is amazing. The design is nice and simple which is perfect for this sort of dress. The issue is the fit. This dress runs very large and the sizing is a bit off.

This dress clings to my butt. I'm not crazy about this but as I lose more weight, that problem will be saved. But then in the chest, it is also too large. I am a DD so a medium should not be too large. It should fit more like in the butt area. Then under the breast, it is very loose. The fabric is very stretchy though so I would almost say that the medium should be for someone wearing a 12 or 14 if they wanted a fitted look. The sizing is just very off and odd for my body. I will likely return. I would still recommend this dress for the right body type because it is lovely and well made with high quality knit fabric.\n",

Awesome for the price.\n",

      "I am sometimes a little hesitant to buy dresses on Amazon after a few showed up \"not as expected\" i a major way.  THIS dress however.... EXCEEDS expectations.  Wowza.  Just enough stretch to hug and enhance a girl's shape, but not so much to feel uncomfortable or to feel cheap.  I was also impressed that it did not seem to stretch out a ton after one wearing, which pleasantly surprised me as the fabric has the feel of a cotton blend. In truth, the fabric feels a bit like the heavy, high quality bandage dress fabric, but less rigid. It held it's shape well after a couple wears. Once I did washed it in my machine(and let air dry), I found it held it's original shape very well.I loved it so much I now have  It in 3 colors: navy, black and red. Each color has he look of high quality dye, and none have faded in the wash so far.HIGHLY recommend\n",

Quality material with the perfect amount of stretch! With some good underpinnings..you'll be good to go! Very sexy/flattering cut.
