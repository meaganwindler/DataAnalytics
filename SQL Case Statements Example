-- Sample SQL to demonstrate my use of Case statements to track learner completion data

-- Using a table structure for training_data as follows:
-- participant_id (INT), module_name (VARCHAR), completion_status (VARCHAR), score (INT)

SELECT
  module_name,
  completion_status,
  -- Now I categorize based on completion status and score
  CASE
    WHEN completion_status = 'Completed' AND score >= 90 THEN 'Highly Proficient'
    WHEN completion_status = 'Completed' AND score >= 75 THEN 'Proficient'
    WHEN completion_status = 'Completed' THEN 'Completed with Improvement Needed'
    ELSE 'Not Completed or No Score'
  END AS performance_category,
  COUNT(participant_id) AS number_of_participants,
  AVG(score) AS average_score
FROM training_data
GROUP BY module_name, completion_status, performance_category
ORDER BY module_name, completion_status;
